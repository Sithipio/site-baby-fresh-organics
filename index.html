        About
    </h2>
    <p class="text-m">
        We started Baby Fresh Organics out of necessity.
    </p>
    <p class="text-m">Our twins were nearly ready to try their very first foods and, like many new parents, we
        had questions.</p><br/>
    <p class="text-m"><em>Which foods first? Store-bought or homemade?</em></p>
    <p class="text-m">Homemade requires time we didn’t have</p><br/>
    <p class="text-m"><em>If we went the store-bought route, which brands could we really trust? And how fresh
        is it, really?</em></p>
    <p class="text-m">Add to this the pressure of including superfoods.</p><br/>
    <p class="text-m"><em>What are they? And where do you get them?</em></p>
    <p class="text-m">Of course, we didn’t want to just <em>feed</em> our babies. We wanted thoughtful and
        purposeful nourishment from the very beginning to help the twins thrive. And we
        quickly discovered other parents felt the same way.</p><br/>
    <p class="text-m">So, we partnered with a Holistic Functional Nutritionist to create <strong>Baby Fresh
        Organics.</strong></p><br/>

    <p class="text-m">
        Our approach is simple: use only nutrient-dense, organic ingredients, sourced seasonally and
        locally whenever possible, to make fresh, hand-made food for your child in our Denver kitchen and deliver it the
        same day, directly to your door.

    <h2 class="title section-4--font-white section-4--main-title">Our Feeding Philosophy</h2>
    <p class="text-m section-4--font-white section-4--text">
        Beyond providing healthy food, we’ve developed a Feeding Philosophy to help parents give their babies and
        children the most nutritious start in life. It underscores our commitment to thoughtful and purposeful
        nutrition, so you can rest assured that each recipe has been crafted based on our nutritional framework.
    </p>
    <div class="wrap-text">
        <h3 class="text-l section-4--font-white section-4--title">Nutrient Deficiencies/Growth and Development</h3>
        <p class="text-s section-4--font-white">Our approach to providing <strong>nutritious complementary
            foods</strong> to
            breast milk or formula and beyond acknowledges that certain nutrients essential for growth and development
            like
            <strong>iron, zinc, calcium, vitamin D and some B vitamins</strong> are not passed through breast milk or
            formula in adequate amounts and certain nutrient deficiencies are common in infants and young children. We
            select foods based on their nutritional profile to provide a wide variety of nutrients.</p>
        <h3 class="text-l section-4--font-white section-4--title">Neurological Function</h3>
        <p class="text-s section-4--font-white">We embrace the critical importance of healthy <strong>omega-3 fatty
            acids</strong> like DHA and EPA and nutrients like <strong>choline</strong> to support your baby’s
            neurological
            function and overall brain development.</p>
        <h3 class="text-l section-4--font-white section-4--title">Robust Immune System and Healthy Gut Microbiome</h3>
        <p class="text-s section-4--font-white">We know the foundation of baby’s microbiome takes shape during the
            <strong>first
                1,000 days</strong>, which is pregnancy plus the first two years of life, and that we can help nurture
            the
            development of a healthy <strong>gut</strong> and a <strong>robust immune system</strong> through proper
            nutrition, from the very start.</p>
        <h3 class="text-l section-4--font-white section-4--title">Developmentally Appropriate Foods</h3>
        <p class="text-s section-4--font-white">We understand that babies aren’t just tiny humans! They have their own
            <strong>unique biochemistry</strong>. We honor those differences and their journey of development with the
            most
            nourishing and age appropriate foods to help them thrive.</p>
        <h3 class="text-l section-4--font-white section-4--title">Macronutrient Balance</h3>
        <p class="text-s section-4--font-white">We acknowledge the importance of <strong>macronutrient balance</strong>
            <em>–
                in every meal, at every age.</em> This means selecting high-quality proteins, healthy fats, and whole
            food
            carbohydrates for all of our products because it’s never too early to start teaching children the value of a
            healthy, balanced meal.</p>
        <h3 class="text-l section-4--font-white section-4--title">Flavor and Taste</h3>
        <p class="text-s section-4--font-white">We believe introducing kids to different flavors, tastes and
            consistencies
            from a young age and teaching them about the importance of real food will help to nurture healthier, more
            adventurous eaters as they grow.</p>
        <br/>
        <p class="text-s section-4--font-white">We’re also acutely aware of the advantage superfoods provide in a baby’s
            diet. Therefore, we include foods like bone marrow, liver, bone broth, probiotic foods, sea vegetables, and
            superfood spices to support our Feeding Philosophy.</p>
        <br/>
        <p class="text-s section-4--font-white">By approaching baby food through this nutrient-focused lens, sourcing
            the
            very freshest ingredients, making food from scratch daily, and delivering it right to your door, Baby Fresh
            Organics empowers parents to give their child the best possible start in life.</p>
